## 🎓 Learning Philosophy

This project follows a **three-tier learning approach**:

### 1️⃣ **Understand** - Minimal Code
Start with clean, minimal implementations that focus purely on the algorithm logic without visual distractions.

### 2️⃣ **Trace** - Console Output  
Add execution traces to see exactly what the algorithm is doing at each step.

### 3️⃣ **Visualize** - Graphical Animation
Experience the algorithm through beautiful, animated visualizations that bring the concepts to life.

## 📊 Algorithm Comparison

| Algorithm | Data Structure | Exploration | Completeness | Space |
|-----------|---------------|-------------|--------------|-------|
| **DFS** | Stack (LIFO) | Deep first | Not guaranteed | O(h) |
| **BFS** | Queue (FIFO) | Wide first | Guaranteed* | O(w) |

\* For finite graphs

## 📚 About This Project

Created as part of an AI learning journey, this project aims to make uninformed search algorithms accessible and engaging through:

- **Multiple learning modalities** (code, text, visuals)
- **Progressive complexity** (beginner to advanced)
- **Practical examples** (runnable code, not just theory)
- **Beautiful visualizations** (making algorithms come alive)

**Inspired by:** *Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach* by Stuart Russell and Peter Norvig
